## About

This is official repository of Verified Bird - get rid of unnecessary "Verified" checkmark from Twitter in one click. If you wish to use a different emoji or text, so be it. Simply open extension page (click on extension icon) and customize it.

## How to install

### Chrome Web Store

Simply install the extension from following link: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/verified-bird/ljmlgobgmbddpldljkhejpcpjimmhjoc). 
This version may not yet be the latest one - it can take a few days for the update to be verified by Google.

### Manual installation

1. Download source code .zip file - from Releases or [directly from Github page](https://github.com/rgryta/Verified-Bird/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Unpack the package file to a separate directory.
1. Head over to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) within Google Chrome (or corresponding packe in a different browser).
1. Enable "Developer Mode" to the top right.
1. Click on "Load Unpacked" from the developer toolbar and choose the unpacked directory from point (2).

## How to use

1. By default the checkmark will be replaced with a clown emoji.
1. Extension (should) work everywhere - not counting screenshots of course. Twitter's page or another one with an embedded tweet - checkmark is gone.
1. You can customize the replacement (or quickly disable the extension) by clicking on its icon and saving new settings.

## Disclaimer

This is a parody project meant to showcase how unnecessary the verification mark has become after allowing everybody to get their own by subscribing to Twitter Blue. Who knows how many verified Elon Musks there's roaming on the Dark Twitter Planes these days.
